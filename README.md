## Description: 

This is a front-end budget tracker app built using React. The user can submit expenses (consisting of an amount($), description, and date) which are then displayed and summed in a table and a line graph below. The project served  required me to build React UI components, manage & access component state, and respond to user events. Implementing the line graph also involved learning how to integrate charts.js into React.
